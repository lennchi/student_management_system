⚙️ oop, sqlite3, pyqt6

⚡   creating classes, inheritance, creating GUI, connecting to and updating databases 

 

A simple (and fake 😁) student management system for desktop created to practice PyQt6, OOP, and using databases (SQLite in this case). You can view, search, add, edit, sort and delete records.

 

It's my Day 45-47 student project for the [Python Mega Course: Learn Python in 60 Days, Build 20 Apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course) course with Ardit Sulce on Udemy.
